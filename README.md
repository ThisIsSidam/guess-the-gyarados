# Pokemon Guessing Game

Welcome to the Pokemon Guessing Game! This is a fun and challenging game where you have to guess a randomly selected Pokemon by answering a series of questions. The game provides no clues, making it a true test of your Pokemon knowledge.

Note: I know that the UI is bad. Please give me ideas, I really need them. I also have some ideas, so I will apply them in a while.
